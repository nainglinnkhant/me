# I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

He taught me a code. To survive. Only you could make those words cute. I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

## You're a killer. I catch killers.

God created pudding, and then he rested. Makes me a … scientist. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Makes me a … scientist. You look…perfect.

Tell him time is of the essence. I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?
