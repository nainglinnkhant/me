# Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Why would a robot need to drink? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Pansy. I'm a thing. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

**t may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years.** _And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels._ When will that be?

## Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! We don't have a brig. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

1. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
2. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.
3. Now what?

### We're also Santa Claus!

You lived before you met me?! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? And why did 'I' have to take a cab?

-   Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
-   Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
-   I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Professor, make a woman out of me. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.

Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fatal. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Kids have names? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

No, just a regular mistake. No. We're on the top. Shut up and take my money! Ooh, name it after me!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Large bet on myself in round one. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. It must be wonderful. I don't want to be rescued.

Why not indeed! Then we'll go with that data file! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

Okay, I like a challenge. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Say it in Russian! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
