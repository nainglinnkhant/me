# I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

You hit me with a cricket bat. Aw, you're all Mr. **Grumpy Face today.** _No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness._ Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

1. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
2. You've swallowed a planet!
3. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

### You've swallowed a planet!

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! _Insistently_ Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! _Insistently_ Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
